# Module 01 Mini-Project: Landing Page

In this mini-project, you will build a landing page using HTML and CSS. While you will be responsible for your own landing page, you will work in a group to brainstorm and share ideas.

## Instructions

Work in your group to implement the following user stories:

* As a client, I want to view a single webpage that collects a visitor's contact information.

* As a client, I want the landing page to have a header and footer.

* As a client, I want the landing page to have an image with a caption.

* As a client, I want the landing page to have a contact form.

* As a client, I want the landing page to have a polished and accessible UI.

## Acceptance Criteria

* It's done when the page uses semantic HTML elements.

* It's done when the page uses universal, element, and class selectors in CSS.

* It's done when the page features at least three colors in the design.

* It's done when the page uses a single font and font family for all text.

* It's done when the page uses at least two heading elements (`<h1>` through `<h6>`).

* It's done when the header is fixed to the top of the page on scroll.

* It's done when the header contains a navigation bar with three links that display inline, including a contact link.

* It's done when, if the contact link is clicked, the page jumps directly to the contact form.

* It's done when the contact form includes `input` elements for name and email.

* It's done when the contact form includes a Send button.
